career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I'm a data scientist with extensive experience in modelling, programming and numerical methods. 
      My passion for programming leads me to develop machine learning-based solutions for companies and universities. 
      Following my passion, I would like to accomplish bigger challenges in my career. 

experiences:
    - role: Research Officer in Data Science
      time: 2020 - Present
      company: Medical School, Swansea University, Swansea, UK
      details: |
          - Application of machine learning algorithms (clustering and deep learning techniques) to detect abnormal behaviour in real cardiac cells optical data and fluorescent calcium measurements. Application to commercial business case. 
          - Image processing for data extraction. Application of machine learning techniques to extract data features. 
          - Design and development of an application with graphic user interface for data analysis of microscope images.  
          - Processing health image big data using own algorithms. Development of our database.
    - role: Research Fellow
      time: 2019 - 2020
      company: Institute of Material Discovery, University College of London, London, UK
      details: |
          - Collaborated with industrial and academic partners to develop a web platform for industry access to materials modelling expertise. This project was funded by the European Union and companies such as Fraunhofer, Enthought, Bosch, etc. 
          - Collaborated with colleagues using Machine Learning to predict materials properties and accelerate materials discovery. Text mining on research databases.
          - Using numerical techniques based on finite element methods (FEM) to optimise industrial composites such as honeycomb or recycled aggregates.     
    - role: Project officer
      time: 2018 - 2019
      company: Swansea University, Swansea, UK
      details: |
          - Application of techniques from the domain of data science such as data pre-processing, neural networks and multi constraint optimisation to reduce costs in steel manufacturing industry. 
          - Developed an addon in Python and JavaScript for a commercial finite element software ANSYS. This addon integrates in the interface of ANSYS application and perform operations to simplify continuum mechanics calculations.
          - Developed Python scripts to collect and analyse large data sets from files, websites, etc.
          - Developed numerical models to improve manufacturing processes in the industry. The processes range from material behaviour prediction to optimisation of properties such as geometry, elastic properties, viscosity, etc.
    - role: Research Assistant
      time: 2017
      company: Swansea University, Swansea, UK
      details: |
        Developed numerical models of a wing energy harvester using Matlab to couple different commercial software. 
        Used Matlab to analyse and study large data sets from experiments.
